# Stable Audio Tools specific (cloned repository)
# If you treat stable-audio-tools as a submodule or a dependency managed
# outside this project's Git history, you might ignore it.
# However, if you intend to make and track modifications to it within this project,
# then you would NOT ignore it.
# For now, let's assume it's a cloned dependency and might not need to be re-committed here.
# If you modify it, remove this line or be more specific.
